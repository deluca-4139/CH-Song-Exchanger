# Clone Hero Song Exchanger

Everyone who's played Clone Hero Online knows this struggle:

> A: "Hey, do you have {insert song here}? It's one of my favorites."
> 
> B: "Oh shoot, I don't think I have that one..."
> 
> A: "Darn... how about {insert other song here}?"
> 
> B: "Nope, not that one..."

With the way that CH Online works, you must both have access to a song's chart if you want to play it; but trying to have your friend download a bunch of songs that you want to play can be annoying, and take up a lot of time trying to figure out where you got all of those charts from. That's where **Clone Hero Song Exchanger** comes in!

*CH-X* allows you to connect directly with your friend, sync your libraries, and determine which songs you are both missing from the other's library. You can then select which songs you want to download from an easy to navigate display, and then download them straight from your friend! No more endless scrolling through Chorus or zipping up songs to send through Discord; *CH-X* handles it all for you.
